## Example Simple Scripts

*“As a developer wanting to exercise a Twitter Tweet API, I want an example script that I can quickly configure and start making API request, and see the raw output.”*

This repository contains example code that demonstrate the basic API methods available on Twitter Enterpise APIs.  These are broken into two categories:

+ Real-time PowerTrack streaming API - Establish a streaming connection to Twitter PowerTrack and volumee streams, using gzip compression
+ Real-time PowerTrack Rules API -Add, Delete, and List rules on PowerTrack Streams
+ Search API - Send requests to Twitter Search API
+ Historical PowerTrack API - Create and monitor Historical PowerTrack jobs						
		
These snippets should serve as an example only for the basic API functions, and do not provide additional functionality that will be crucuial to the success of your application (e.g. reconnect logic, batching rule updates, complying with rate limits, validating rules, retrying failed updates, etc.).
