<h1>PowerTrack Rule Management</h1>
<h2>Ruby Examples</h2>
<p>The following Ruby snippets demonstrate how to perform the following rule-management operations on the PowerTrack Rules API.
<ul>
	<li>
		Add a rule to a stream</li>
	<li>
		Delete a rule from a stream</li>
	<li>
		Retrieve the list of rules for a stream</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Each snippet provides examples of what the stream URL should look like for each type described above, and includes specific lines that may be commented or uncommented depending on the type of stream you are using.  The files for adding a rule and retrieving a rule will work for PowerTrack 1.0 and 2.0 while there is a separate file for each version of the script to delete a rule.</p>
