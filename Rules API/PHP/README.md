# PowerTrack Rule Management

## PHP Examples

The following PHP snippets demonstrate how to perform the following rule-management operations on the PowerTrack Rules API.

- Add a rule to a stream
- Delete a rule from a stream
- GET the list of rules for a stream

There are four variables that you need to provide in order to get these snippets working for your account:

1. Account Name (e.g., NameOfYourCompany)
2. Stream Lable (e.g., prod)
3. Username (yourname@yourcompany.com)
4. Password

Once you've added your details to the snippet, you can easily test it via the command-line:

`php AddRule.php`
or 
`php DeleteRule.php`
or
`php ListRules.php
